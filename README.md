# Overview

By typing this code I wanted to understand how to create the basics of an app for an android device.

This app rolls dice and shows the user the result of the dice rolls.

# Development Environment

I used Andoid Studio to create the app.

Kotlin was the Main language used.

# Future Work

* I would like to add another screen for the Dice to display on.
